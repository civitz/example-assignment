## Questions

* any constraints on the API? Can it be a JSON-based REST service?
* what about authentication? Shall I design a form of authentication in the API? Can we assume the presence of an API gateway on top?
* what format should I use for the API spec and architecture? A PDF with explanation and diagrams?
