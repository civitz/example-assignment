# Excercise 2: organizing assets in folders with a tree structure

Digital asset management with folders structure

## Context (elaborated)

* folders can contain other folders and also assets (files)
* assets have metadata that need to be stored
* assets are deduplicated: one asset can be stored in different folders
* no asset limit
* no folder limit
* no asset-per-folder limit

## Questions

* auth?
* can we assume we have an object storage/cdn for arbitrary files?
